# Hi ðŸ‘‹,

I am an SRE with a keen interest in programming, system design, and software engineering.

I enjoy reading books because I believe that true knowledge lies in understanding the inner workings of things, and books help me achieve that. You can find some recommended books on DevOps [here](https://99devops.com/books).

Please feel free to reach out to me directly via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabeshthapa) if you would like to discuss anything, such as technology, career advice, resume review, or PR review. I will do my best to assist you.
