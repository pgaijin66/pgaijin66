# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m a SRE with SE background with around 5 years of experience. I am currently living in San Diego, California. I started my career as a systems engineer and later transitioned to Site Reliability Engineering. 

ðŸš´  I have an avid interest in software engineering and backend development but i also have thousands other interests and Iâ€™m always looking to add more. Some one which are ( not in any order ), painting, cooking, watching movies, playing guitar.

ðŸŽ¯  My goal in life is to be 0.00001% better than what i was yesterday. To what extent, i would succeed ? Time will tell but as the saying goes "It's not the destination, but the journey that matters" hence i am trying to enjoying every bit of this journey.

ðŸ“¦  All the repositories in here are the storage for whatever technical things i have been working on lately, mostly for my own gratification. If anyone finds it useful for interesting, even better.

ðŸ“š  I love reading tech books and have started sharing key takeaways of all the books i read. You can find it here [books](https://99devops.com/books)
  
ðŸ™‹  I am looking to collaborate on projects related to system design, backend development and information security so, please reach out if you have such projects.
  
ðŸ“«  Please feel free to reach out to me directly via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabeshthapa) if you want to talk about anything. I mean almost anything, tech or non tech, career advise, personal struggles etc and i will listen. I believe that *"A good friend is always better than money in the pocket"*.
