# Hi there 👋,

Hi, I'm a **SRE with SE background**. I started my career as a system engineer and later transitioned to Site Reliability Engineering. My aim in life is to help increase other developers productivity by building different tools and technologies to assit them in their daily life.

📖 I love reading tech books and have started sharing key takeaways of all the books i read. You can find it here **[books](https://99devops.com/books)**

🙏 I believe in followings:
- As an engineer **we should be agnostic to platform, tool and language.**
- **Coding in ready heavy work** [psychology of code readability](https://medium.com/@egonelbre/psychology-of-code-readability-d23b1ff1258a)
- **Refactoring must be part of dev cycle**. [Make It Work Make It Right Make It Fast](https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast)
- Failure is eminient. **Make sure you are handling those failure well.** [Error handling](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/error-handling.html)

  
🙋 I am looking to collaborate on projects related to system design, backend development and information security.

  
💬 Ask me about **programming**. **devops/sre**, **networking**, **security** and all things **linux**.
