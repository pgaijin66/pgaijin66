# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

Hi, I'm Prabesh, a SRE with SE background. I have avid interest in OS internals, backend engineering and systems design. I like to solve complex problems. Work wise i prefer working on desining systems and solutions that are agnostic to particular technology. I love reading books and solving coding challenges.
