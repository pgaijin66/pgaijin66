# Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

Iâ€™m a SRE with SE background with around 5 years of experience. 

ðŸš´  I have an avid interest in software engineering and backend development but i also have thousands other interests and Iâ€™m always looking to add more. Some of them are ( not in any order ), painting, cooking, watching movies, playing guitar.

ðŸ“¦  All the repositories in here are the storage for whatever technical things i have been working on lately, mostly for my own gratification. If anyone finds it useful or interesting, even better.

ðŸ“š  I love reading books. You can find my previous readings here [books](https://99devops.com/books)
    
ðŸ“«  Please feel free to reach out to me directly via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabeshthapa) if you want to talk about anything. I mean almost anything, tech or non tech, career advise, resume review, personal help etc. I believe that *"A good friend is always better than money in the pocket"*.
