# Hi ðŸ‘‹,

ðŸš´  I have an avid interest in software engineering and backend development but i also have thousands other interests and Iâ€™m always looking to add more. Some of them are ( not in any order ), painting, cooking, watching movies, playing guitar.

ðŸ“¦  All the repositories in here are the storage for whatever technical things i have been working on lately, mostly for my own gratification.

ðŸ“š  I love reading books. I believe true knowledge lies in the inner working on things and books helps me achieve them. [books](https://99devops.com/books)
